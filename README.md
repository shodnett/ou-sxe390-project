# SXE390 Project
A repo displaying code and data files used during my SXE390 project, the final module of the BSc Environmental Science with the Open University.

Dissertation title was "The influence of tidal range on sediment and dissolved heavy metals in UK estuaries, for evaluating ecological toxicity risk"


# Formatting
The script (metals.ipynb) is in Jupyter notebook format, and reads data from the Excel file (Appendix_4.xlsx) also included in this repo, so both will need to be downloaded if users want to run the script and reproduce displayed graphs.
It assumes imported packages have been installed, if using miniconda. 

Any edits made to .xlsx file name in a local copy once forked need to be rectified in the script (see line 10-11 of code)

Any questions, ping me an email [stephchodnett@gmail.com](mailto:stephchodnett@gmail.com) or message me on Discord. Thank you!
